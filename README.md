# Axum

Seems promising, especially as built of the Tokio/Tower stack.

## Things To Tick Off

In no particular order:

- [x] path params
- [ ] send JSON (with param based input) -- correct mime type
- [ ] peceive a struct and de-serialize it (POST body)
- [ ] use some form of app state in handler .. like a cache etc
- [ ] errors on de-serialize
- [ ] Option?? in Params and structs
- [ ] serve static files
- [ ] read / add headers
- [ ] cookies 
- [ ] TLS / HTTPS
- [ ] user based security 
- [ ] file upload
